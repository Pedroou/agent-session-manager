# Design

**Date:** 2026-09-04, revised 2026-09-08
**Status:** Implemented. Installed by `./install.fish`.
**Plasmoid id:** `com.claudeaccmanager.claudesessions`

## Goal

You run several Claude Code sessions at once, in different terminals and
different projects. One of them is blocked on a permission prompt while you are
reading another. The widget answers one question from the panel, without you
alt-tabbing through terminals: **is any session waiting on me?** Opening it
answers the follow-ups: which one, in which project, on which branch, for how
long, and how much of the plan each account has left.

## Non-goals

- No control over what a session is *doing*. It can end a session, because that
  is a signal the process handles; it cannot interrupt one (see "Interrupting",
  below).
- No history. A session that has exited is gone from the list, not greyed out.
- No renaming of the real session. Claude Code owns that name and rewrites its
  record constantly; the widget keeps a nickname of its own instead.

## Data source

Claude Code already publishes most of what the widget needs. Every running
session maintains its own record at `<profile-dir>/sessions/<pid>.json` and
rewrites it whenever its state changes:

```json
{
  "pid": 299676,
  "sessionId": "8bc54fbf-…",
  "cwd": "/home/dev/code/checkout-flow",
  "name": "checkout-flow-7",
  "kind": "interactive",
  "status": "waiting",
  "waitingFor": "input needed",
  "procStart": "1789211",
  "startedAt": 1788540652634,
  "statusUpdatedAt": 1788543329846,
  "version": "2.1.263"
}
```

No hooks and no polling of transcripts for live state. `status` is a closed set
of four values, confirmed against the binary (`var Ke=["busy","shell","idle",
"waiting"]`, guarding the field on read).

### The six states

Four come from the registry. Two are worked out here, because the registry has
no idea about either.

| Shown as    | Source                                    | Means                                                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Waiting** | `status: waiting`                         | Blocked on you — a permission prompt, a dialog, an MCP request. `waitingFor`/`needs` says which. |
| **Error**   | worked out — transcript                   | Idle, and its last turn ended in an API error. The message is shown. |
| **Running** | worked out — `/proc`                      | Busy, with a shell command or script executing. The command is shown. |
| **Working** | `status: busy`                            | Claude is generating, with no command out                    |
| **Shell**   | `status: shell`                           | The session has handed the terminal to a shell               |
| **Done**    | `status: idle`                            | Finished; waiting for your next prompt                       |

A seventh display state, **unknown**, catches any value a future version
invents: it is counted and listed with the raw status title-cased, never
dropped. The order above is also the sort order and the order the summary
sentence reads in.

**Running** is detected from the process tree. Claude Code runs every Bash tool
call as a direct child shell of its own process; its long-lived children are MCP
servers (`npm exec …`), which are not shells, so the two never get confused. The
`eval '…'` payload in the child's `cmdline` is the command, and it is shown.
Subagents run *inside* the process and leave no trace in `/proc`, so a session
thinking through a subagent is indistinguishable from one thinking on its own —
both read as Working.

**Error** is detected from the transcript. A session whose turn fails goes back
to `idle`, but the transcript records it, and the last assistant entry carries
`isApiErrorMessage` with a message worth reading ("You've hit your session limit
· resets 6:40pm", "Login expired · Please run /login"). The transcript is a
lagging source — the assistant's own `tool_use` entry is not flushed while a
tool runs — which is exactly why it is only trusted for a state the session has
already stopped in.

### Liveness

A record outlives its session when the process is killed rather than exiting
cleanly, so a record alone does not mean "running". Each one is checked the way
Claude Code checks its own: the process must exist **and** field 22 of
`/proc/<pid>/stat` — the start time in clock ticks — must equal the record's
`procStart`. That second half is what rules out a recycled pid.

### Both profiles

`sessions/` is per-profile: `~/.claude/sessions` and
`~/.claude-personal/sessions` are separate directories (unlike `projects/`,
which the profile scripts share via symlink). Both are read, and each session
carries the profile it came from. The profile is only *shown* on a row when the
personal profile actually has a session running.

### Plan usage

The percentages behind Claude Code's own `/usage` come from one authenticated
call, using the bearer token each profile already stores:

```
GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>          # from <profile>/.credentials.json
anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20
```

The token goes to curl through stdin (`--config -`), never argv, so it does not
appear in the process list. `limits[]` already carries a percentage, a severity,
a reset time and — for scoped limits — the model they belong to, so the bars on
offer are whatever the plan actually has rather than a hardcoded three. Today
that is Session, Weekly and Fable.

This is the only part of the widget that touches the network, so it is the only
part with an off switch, and it runs on a five-minute timer rather than the
session poll.

### The isolation boundary

Everything with a decision in it sits in one of four testable units; the QML
binds and lays out.

**`scripts/claude-sessions`** owns the registry: which directories to read,
which records are live, how a status maps to a state, the two states that are
worked out rather than read, the git repository and branch behind each session,
and what order they come in. It prints one document and nothing else, which is
also how it is tested — `test/test-collectors.fish` builds a throwaway `$HOME`, a
throwaway `/proc` (`CLAUDE_SESSIONS_PROC`) and throwaway transcripts, and runs
the real script against them.

**`scripts/claude-usage`** owns the credentials and the API call, with
`CLAUDE_USAGE_FIXTURE` standing in for the network under test.

**`code/sessions.js`** and **`code/usage.js`** own presentation: relative ages,
the summary sentence broken into colourable parts, which state dominates, the
detail rows and their order, the resume command's shell quoting, and the
fallbacks when a limit or a profile is missing. Plain JavaScript with no Qt
import, loaded by node in `test/`.

Costs, measured: the session collector is two subprocesses and ~75 ms; it reads
`/proc` and record bodies with fish builtins rather than forked `cat`s, which is
what took it there from ~520 ms.

### Data flow

1. A `Timer` in `main.qml` fires — every second while the popup is open, every
   `refreshInterval` seconds (default 5) while it is closed. A second, five-minute
   timer drives usage.
2. `Plasma5Support.DataSource` (`executable` engine) runs the collector,
   resolved from inside the package with `Qt.resolvedUrl`.
3. `onNewData` parses stdout, or sets `failure` from stderr. A non-zero exit,
   empty output, or unparseable JSON is a failure state, never a silent empty
   list. A failed *usage* fetch leaves the last good reading on screen instead.
4. The views bind to `shown` (the configured filter applied) and `shownCounts`
   (derived from `shown`, so the header can never contradict the list).

## What it looks like

The one invented device is the **rail**: a session is a rounded bar, and the same
bar appears in both representations, so the popup reads as the panel opened up.
All rails are the same length; colour alone carries the state.

Status colours are the widget's own rather than the theme's, because the theme
accent is usually blue and blue is exactly what disappears into a blue panel.
The defaults are mid-tones — the weight a palette reserves for "legible on either
background" — and every one of them is overridable:

| State   | Default   | Why                                                        |
|---------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Waiting | `#f97316` | orange: a person has to do something                        |
| Error   | `#ef4444` | red: the long-standing meaning, not worth reinventing       |
| Running | `#eab308` | yellow: busy, but nobody is being waited on                 |
| Working | `#06b6d4` | cyan: active, and the one that had to leave blue behind     |
| Shell   | `#94a3b8` | slate: a real state, but not one to shout about             |
| Done    | `#22c55e` | green: finished                                             |

Blue is the commonest convention for "in progress" and is deliberately unused; a
test asserts no default is a blue.

**Panel.** The bars side by side, with the running total beside them in the
colour of the state with the most sessions — except that anything blocked on a
person wins outright, however few, since that is the question the panel exists to
answer. Capped at eight bars; past that the number carries it. Nothing running
draws one faint tick — quiet, not broken. Vertical panels stack the bars.

**Popup.** A heading, then one sentence — "1 waiting for you, 3 working" — with
each count in its own status colour, then the list, sorted with anything blocked
at the top. The popup is as tall as its sessions need and no taller, up to a
ceiling in settings, past which the list scrolls.

```

Clicking a row opens its details — Profile, Uptime, Directory, Repository,
Branch, Session, Process, Version — and clicking any value copies it. Right-
clicking copies the whole thing when open, and the command to get back into the
session when closed.

Every copy is confirmed by a pill that floats over the list for about two
seconds. It floats rather than sitting in the layout so a copy never reflows the
popup under the pointer, and it names what it took — "Repository copied",
"Resume command copied" — because a single row offers half a dozen copy targets
and a bare "Copied" would leave you guessing which one you hit. It is
deliberately not a system notification: this is a keystroke-sized action, and
routing it to the notification centre would bury the messages that matter. Hovering reveals a pencil, which gives the session a
nickname the widget keeps, and a close button that asks once before ending it.
The eye in the header blanks every name and path for screen-sharing.

**Motion.** Exactly one thing moves on its own: a working session breathes — the
rail and its "Working" label together. The label follows the rail's opacity
rather than running a second animation, because two identical animations started
in the same frame look synchronised right up until something restarts one of
them. It stops when the user has turned animations off.

## Interrupting

There is no interrupt button, and this is the one item on the request list that
could not be built as asked.

Claude Code puts the terminal in raw mode and reads Ctrl+C as a *byte* off the
input stream. Its actual signal handlers do something else entirely:

```js
process.on("SIGINT", () => { …; rU(); this.shutdown(0) })
process.on("SIGTERM", () => { …; rU(); this.shutdown(0) })
```

Both signals mean "shut down". So a signal can end a session but cannot pause
one, and a button labelled "interrupt" that quietly ended sessions would be worse
than no button. Ending is kept, because SIGTERM is genuinely the graceful path
and the transcript survives — which is what the right-click resume command is
for. Doing this properly would mean speaking the peer protocol on
`messagingSocketPath`, which is undocumented and not worth the risk here.

## Error and empty states

| Condition                          | Panel                     | Popup                                                    |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

| Before the first result            | faint tick                | nothing — an empty list would be a guess, not an answer   |
| Collector failed / unparseable     | tick in the error colour  | "Can't read the session list" + stderr                    |
| A torn or malformed record         | unaffected                | that one record is skipped, the rest still listed         |
| Profile not signed in              | unaffected                | "Not signed in" in place of its usage bar                 |
| Token expired                      | unaffected                | "Signed out — run claude to sign back in"                 |
| Usage API unreachable              | unaffected                | last good reading stays; "Couldn't reach the usage API" if there was none |

## Settings

All of it resets from one button at the top of the page.

- **Check every** *n* seconds (1–60, default 5) while the popup is closed.
- **Tallest the popup gets** (8–60 grid units, default 21).
- **Show**: sessions that are done · the session count in the panel · the
  needs-attention highlight · plan usage.
- **Customize status colours** — off uses the built-ins; on reveals a picker per
  state, each with its own revert button. Turning it off goes back to the
  defaults rather than to the last colours picked.
- **Session details** — Repository, Branch (and whether the branch gets its own
  row or rides on the repository as `repo/branch`), Session, Process, Version.
  Profile, Uptime and Directory are not optional: they are what the expansion is
  for. Directory and Repository can be abbreviated to Dir and Repo.
- **Hide session names and paths** — the same toggle as the eye in the header.

## Risks

- **The registry is a Claude Code internal.** `sessions/<pid>.json` is not
  documented API, and the `status` vocabulary could grow. Two things contain
  that: an unrecognised status is displayed rather than dropped, and all the
  interpretation lives in one fish script with its own test suite.
- **So is the usage endpoint**, and so is `isApiErrorMessage`. A change to
  either degrades one panel of the widget, not the widget.
- **`/proc` is Linux-only.** So is a Plasma panel, so this costs nothing here.
- **Plasma caches applet QML.** After an upgrade the shell has to be restarted
  before the new code loads; `install.fish` says so rather than doing it.
